The buttons use the sites accent color to attract more attention to them and to add a splash of color to the site.

  - The regular buttons are for cards and forms, as well as wherever a background is light
  - The light buttons are better suited for areas of the site with darker backgrounds
  - The ghost button is to be used only on the banner

Feel free to change the font size of the text within the buttons if you need a larger size.
