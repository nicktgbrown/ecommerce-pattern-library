fonts:
  primary: |
    The primary font choice is used to represent the aesthetic of the brand, as well as effectively convey information. It is stronger than the body copy to create hierarchy.

    Primary font should be used for things such as headings, navigation, and anything that needs to stand out.

  secondary: |
    The secondary font choice is used to maintain theme and aesthetic but also properly convey body copy and smaller text, and maintain readability throughout the site. It is thinner and less decorative to be more functional and readable throughout the site and over different screen sizes.

    Secondary font should be used for body copy and most default text.
colors:
  primary: |
    The primary color is meant to maintain the aesthetic of the bagelboi brand, which scarcely uses color. It often uses just black and white to maintain a simple, clean theme.
  accent: |
    The accent is just used to bring a bit more style to the site. It is only to be used on buttons and to highlight specific information. It is also often used for the hover-states of most links. Sale prices on items will also use this color.
  neutral: |
    The neutral color is meant to separate things like cards and specific sections from the surrounding white backgrounds.
